# FakeSSNScamGag
Gag Python Script that asks the user for basic information, then suddenly their SSN. Script is programmed with many different responses.

# FAQ:

* Does this script actually take my SSN?

  * No. This is just a silly gag with a handful of programmed responses.

* Why is this script so long? Seems kinda sus to me..

  * The script is long because of the different types of yes/no answers it can receive. I added notes next to each section for people to better understand the script.

* What do you mean by different yes/no answers? I tried inputting "potato," but it yelled at me!
  * Python in general takes case very seriously, meaning there can be different responses for different case. (ex. "yes" is not the same as "yEs" or "Yes" and so on.)

* How long did this script take to write?
  * About an hour. This is my first python script I have ever wrote so it took some learning and alot of ctrl + c and ctrl + v.

* I'm concerned about other data, like my name, being entered into this script.
  * I assure you that as long as you run the script in a secure environment, your information will be safe.

* Are you sure there's no hidden tricks? >:(
  * **YES. IT'S JUST A GAG.**
