# FakeSSNScamGag
Gag Python Script that asks the user for basic information, then suddenly their SSN. Script is programmed with many different responses.

# FAQ:

Q: Does this script actually take my SSN?
A: No. This is just a silly gag with a handful of programmed responses.

Q: Why is this script so long? Seems kinda sus to me..
A: The script is long because of the different types of yes/no answers it can receive. I added notes next to each section for people to better see the script.

Q: What do you mean by different yes/no answers? I tried inputting "potato," but it yelled at me!
A: Python in general takes case very seriously, meaning there can be different responses for different case. (ex. "yes" is not the same as "yEs" or "Yes" and so on.)

Q: How long did this script take to write?
A: About an hour. This is my first python script I have ever wrote so it took some learning and alot of ctrl + c and ctrl + v.

Q: I'm concerned about other data, like my name, being entered into this script.
A: I assure you that as long as you run the script in a respectable environment, your information will be kept confidential.

Q: Are you sure there's no hidden tri-
A: YES. IT'S JUST A GAG.
